## R Markdown

This is a Project to analyze air pollutants in USA in past ten years. The data with 6 main pollutants accrossing the whole country were downloaded from United States Environmental Protection Agency website. Massachusetts and Boston were used as representative to analyze the pollutant alteration and their relationship from 2006-2015.

##The data list for analysis
